#JBinary [![](https://jitpack.io/v/AlbinEriksson/JBinary.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#AlbinEriksson/JBinary)
JBinary is a binary file framework for Java 1.8.
It aims to be a simple way to work with binary files, as a helper in your code.
##What does it do?
Currently, it is used for reading sequences of bytes and read them bit by bit. An example exists below.
##How to setup
You have to first setup either Maven or Gradle for your project.
Then, go to https://jitpack.io/#AlbinEriksson/JBinary for instructions on how to get the latest release (click on "Get it" at the top of the list).
##Contributing

##Still need help?
If anything was unclear or missing in this readme, please contact me and I can fix that.
##Example
A date and time can be stored like this: `yyyyyyyy yyyMMMMd ddddHHHH Hmmmmmms sssss---`
Each letter represents a bit which is needed for each value. "y" is for year, "M" is for month, etc. The "-" is unused. The space represents how the bytes are separated. As you can see, this might be a little difficult to read using standard bitwise operators. But with JBinary, the code looks something like this:

    BitReader bit = new BitReader(new byte[]
    {(byte)0xFC, (byte)0x11, (byte)0xC5, (byte)0x56, (byte)0xF0});
    int year   = bit.getNextInt(11); // 11 bits in a year (0 to 2047),
    int month  = bit.getNextInt(4);  //  4 bits in a month (0 to 15),
    int day    = bit.getNextInt(5);  //  5 bits in a day (0 to 31),
    int hour   = bit.getNextInt(5);  //  5 bits in an hour (0 to 31),
    int minute = bit.getNextInt(6);  //  6 bits in a minute (0 to 63) and
    int second = bit.getNextInt(6);  //  6 bits in a second (0 to 63).
    bit.addToBitIndex(3);            //  Unused.
    System.out.printf("%d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d",
	    year, month, day, hour, minute, second);
That code prints "2016-08-28 10:43:30" which is the time as of writing this.
